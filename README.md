The objective of this project was to develop an automated system for counting oranges on trees using advanced object detection technology. Traditional methods rely on manual counting, which is time-intensive and prone to human error, particularly when dense foliage obscures the fruit. By automating this process, the system provides farmers and researchers with accurate and efficient fruit yield estimates, enhancing productivity and decision-making.
