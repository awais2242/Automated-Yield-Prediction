The goal of this project was to create a system that could count oranges in trees automatically using technology that identifies objects. The current way of counting oranges is time-consuming and can have errors because people make mistakes. It's also hard to count oranges when the trees have lots of leaves. An automated system can help farmers and researchers get more accurate estimates of how much fruit they will harvest.
